# React Finnancial Visitor
- The goal is to create something that can help people visualize where their money is going with minimal work
  
## So far given the an income for a month and the expenses it will:
- Provide a doughnut chart showing spent vs saved
- Show a bar chart that shows how much money you will have in a select amount of years at a user selected interest rate
- Drop Downs that will give finnacial information

## Plans
- add either a sankey diagram or radar chart to better visualize where money was spent in a month
- incorporate adding a csv file of transactions for a month
- stock tracking
