        <p className="text-white sm:text-xl text-lg">
          A powerful financial goal is to increase the 'Saved' portion. A
          popular guideline is the <strong>50/30/20 rule</strong>: 50% for Needs
          (rent, groceries, utilities) 30% for Wants (dining out, hobbies,
          subscriptions) 20% for Savings & Debt Payoff.{" "}
          {Number(income) > 0 &&
            `Based on your monthly income you have an ideal budget for you is $${(
              Number(income) / 2
            ).toFixed(2)} for needs, $${(Number(income) * 0.3).toFixed(
              2
            )} for wants, and $${(Number(income) * 0.2).toFixed(2)} `}
          How does your chart compare to this 20% savings goal?

      <DropDown label="What counts as a need vs want?">
        <strong>Needs</strong> Things that are required to live/work <br /> Ex:
        Rent, groceries, utilities, transportation, basic phone plan
        <br />
        <strong>Wants</strong> Things that are nice to have but not essential

      <div className="flex flex-col w-full items-center justify-center">
        <DropDown label="How can I save more?">
          Start by tracking your <strong>Wants</strong>. These are flexible
          expenses that can be reduced without changing your lifestyle
          overnight.
          <br />
          <br />
          Try one small change this month:
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Cancel or pause 1 subscription</li>
            <li>Reduce dining out by just 1-2 meals per week</li>
            <li>Set a weekly spending limit for fun purchases</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          Shifting just $20-50 a week moves you closer to that target fast.
          {Number(saved) <= 0
            ? " If you spent more than you earned, focus on tracking first awareness saves money"
            : ""}
        </DropDown>
        <DropDown label="What can I do with my savings?">
          The first step is building an <strong>emergency fund</strong>. Aim for
          3-6 months of your <strong>spent</strong> amount saved ($
          {Number(spent) * 3} to ${Number(spent) * 6}). Keep it in a safe,
          easy-access account like a High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA).
          <br />
          <br />
          After that, here are smart priorities for your savings:
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Pay down high-interest debt</strong> (credit cards, BNPL).
              Paying off 20% interest is like earning 20% guaranteed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Start investing for growth</strong>—Roth IRA, 401(k)
              match, or low-cost index funds. This is how money works for you
              which you will learn about in the next lesson.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Short-term goals</strong> (travel, first car, new phone).
              If you'll spend it within 1-3 years, keep it in savings—not
              stocks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reward yourself</strong> sometimes! Saving is about
              progress, not punishment.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          Small amounts add up. The key is to give every dollar a job that moves
          you forward.
