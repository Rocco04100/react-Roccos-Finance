                lifestyle overnight.
                <br />
                <br />
                Try one small change this month:

                  <li>Cancel or pause 1 subscription</li>

                </ul>
                <br />
                Shifting just $20-50 a week moves you closer to that target

                The first step is building an <strong>emergency fund</strong>.
                Aim for 3-6 months of your <strong>spent</strong> amount saved
                ($
                {Number(spent) * 3} to ${Number(spent) * 6}). Keep it in a safe,
                easy-access account like a High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA).
                <br />
                <br />
                After that, here are smart priorities for your savings:
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Pay down high-interest debt</strong> (credit cards,
                    BNPL). Paying off 20% interest is like earning 20%
                    guaranteed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Start investing for growth</strong>â€”Roth IRA, 401(k)
                    match, or low-cost index funds. This is how money works for
                    you which you will learn about in the next lesson.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Short-term goals</strong> (travel, first car, new
                    phone). If you'll spend it within 1-3 years, keep it in
                    savingsâ€”not stocks.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Reward yourself</strong> sometimes! Saving is about
                    progress, not punishment.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                Small amounts add up. The key is to give every dollar a job that
                moves you forward.

                  Compound interest is at work in many types of accounts. The
                  main difference is the growth rate and risk:

                    <strong>High-Yield Savings Accounts: (HYSAs):</strong>
                    These are very safe (FDIC insured) and are perfect for your
                    emergency fund. They offer lower interest rates (like 1-5%),
                    but your money still compounds.

                    <strong>Investing in the Stock Market: </strong>
                    This is where you see powerful, long-term compounding. By
                    buying low-cost index funds (in a retirement account or
                    brokerage account), your money grows with the market, which
                    has historically averaged 6-10%. This involves risk however
                    because stocks can go down as well.

                    <strong>Certificates of Deposit (CDs):</strong> Fixed-term
                    bank deposits with a guaranteed interest rate. Interest
                    compounds over the term. Low risk, but funds are locked
                    until maturity.
